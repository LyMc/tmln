# Game ideas

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/tmln)

### Economic strategy with a timeline

- Buildings: produce units and resources
- Units: work in the buildings
- Natural resources: places with a resource
- Resources: are consumed to create new things
- Events: something good or bad can happen
- Enemy: destroies the player base
- Ally: works together by sharing resources and help

## Strategy "Timeline"

The idea is to be constantly in change, sometime player will advance, other
times he will retreat. He can start as a farmer and become a king. The player
is not a single character, instead he will manage units that will work and
produce resources. Resources should be alive, and change it time. Events will
move the game and provide the challenge in the game.

## Strategy "Cell"

Units can be cells, single cell organisms that can multiply by clonning
themselves. They can also mutate and become another type of organism. In this
game, some mutation may be good and keep the game going, and other mutations
will become dangerous and will be considered an enemy. The starting animation
can be different particles that assemble together in a single cell.

## RPG "Soul"

The player is a soul, and he will start the game by being born in a family.
This will give him a starting point, a body and some resources, like food for
a few years, time to learn some skills. At some point he may become
independent. He can do anything, as there won't be any quests, but arround him
events will happen. When the player dies, he losses the body and resources.
But, he can wait to be born again in another body at a different place and
time. On death, he will receive karma (good or bad) that he can use in the
next life to be more lucky. Karma is the score of the game.
